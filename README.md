# BSSN AMR Numerical Relativity

Hello! This is a small project implementing an octree, tile-based AMR for numerical relativity simulation. Alongside this, many decisions for parallelism and concurrency were made for said purpose. 
This library/application takes several (potentially unconventional) design choices aimed for acceptably fast computation on low-end consumer hardware (namely mine) and to be reworkable for other projects like CFD in principle.

## Design Choices

1. Support and use of 4-byte compressed float3's to store intermediate variables like derivatives, Christoffel symbols, etc. 
  - `compressed_float3` compresses 3 floating point numbers with a shared 5 bit exponent (with offset 16 by default), and a triplet of sign bits and 8 bit mantissas.
  - Quantization errors are mitigated by adding random noise on the order of $2^{E-7}$ where $E$ is the exponent after offset. This destroys consistent quantization errors and renders compressed values unbiased estimators of their uncompressed values.

2. An octree managed CPU-side, marshalling "domains" and their associated memory regions on the GPU.
  - Every domain contains `size_domain`Â³ voxels usable for simulation, padded by `padding_domain` ghost cells at the boundaries; said ghost cells are copied from neighbouring or coarser domains with interpolation in space and time.
  - Boundary information may only be copied from coarser or equally fine domains (at depths no greater than the desired domain) such that simulation timings can remain consistent.
  - Simulation timesteps run twice as often for domains one level deeper, adapted for hyperbolic PDEs with CFL conditions. Said timesteps are kept track of by a single counter that runs from `0` to `2^max_depth-1`, and bitshifted to maintain consistency when refinement and coarsening occurs.

3. First Derivatives and diagonal components of Hessian computed at once and compressed. Off-diagonal components of the Hessian are computed separately with care to boundary handling.
  - Derivatives are computed from only uncompressed data to reduce quantization errors.
